# Twirrer - A Twitter Clone

Welcome to **Twirrer**, a front-end-only Twitter clone designed for web practice. This repository showcases a simple static version of what a Twitter-like platform might look like using just vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Twirrer is primarily a practice project focusing on honing front-end development skills. While it might resemble Twitter in appearance and a few functionalities, it's static and does not connect to a backend or database. It serves as an excellent foundation for anyone looking to expand upon it or use it as a starting point for more complex projects.
